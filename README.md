Frontend Mentor - Blog Preview Card Starter Project

This is my second challenge for Frontend Mentor. I have been learning HTML/CSS non-stop for last 6days.
I originally learnt HTML/CSS when i was in college but we used mainly dreamweaver to create websites and using photoshop to slice up images to make websites.

One of the main things I need to remember is:
    MARGINs is outside of the element
    PADDING is inside of the element.
